Description: unpack lz4json files, usually generated by Mozilla programs
 Instead of a standard .json.lz4, Firefox uses its own format to compress
 its bookmarks and session restore files.  This tool lets you read them,
 converting to json.  Going from json to a human-readable format is then
 up to you.
 .
 These files typically have these file extensions:
  * baklz4
  * jsonlz4
  * mozlz4
